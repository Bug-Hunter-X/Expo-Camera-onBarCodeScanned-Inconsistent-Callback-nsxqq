The inconsistent behavior of `onBarCodeScanned` can be mitigated by using a debounce function to throttle the barcode scanning events. This prevents the function from being called multiple times in rapid succession, which may lead to missed detections.  Here's an example using Lodash's `debounce` function:

```javascript
import { Camera, BarCodeScanner } from 'expo-camera';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
import _ from 'lodash';

const debouncedHandleBarCodeScanned = _.debounce((data) => {
  console.log('Scanned barcode:', data.data);
}, 500); // Adjust debounce time as needed

// ... rest of your component code

<BarCodeScanner
  onBarCodeScanned={scanned => {
    debouncedHandleBarCodeScanned(scanned);
  }}
/>
```
This solution introduces a delay (500 milliseconds in this case) before processing each scanned barcode. You can adjust the delay to find a balance between responsiveness and accuracy.  Consider experimenting with different debounce times to determine the optimal value for your specific use case.
